## ðŸ§± Lego Store

We will build out an small online lego store using SvelteKit for the frontend, Snipcart to manage the checkout and Directus for storing our lego product details and images. The store will have the basic pages you expect from a an eCommerce store, linking them hierarchically in an SEO friendly way recommended by Google. That&rsquo;s not the end of the SEO side of things though! We see how you can let Google and other search engines know about product prices, reviews and where the images are. With the right information Google will be able to create featured snippets in search results. These let your eCommerce store stand out from others returned in results. We will also use edge functions paired with Directus search capability to add a quick search facility without the need to add an external service or host you own Open Source search instance.
